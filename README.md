# Graph theory
This repository contains basic implementations of algorithms from graph theory for Lazarus. The project features input and output via an adjacency matrix, that automatically mirrors changes for both directions and a simple graphical representation.

Currently, the following algorithms are included:

Spanning Tree algorithms (unweighted graphs):
* Breadth-first search
* Depth-first search

Minimal spanning Tree algorithms (weighted graphs):
* Kruskal algorithm
* Prim algorithm
